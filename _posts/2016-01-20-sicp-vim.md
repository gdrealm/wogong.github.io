SICP means Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programmings. This quick note is for a Common Lisp environment configuration for learning SICP on Windows.

Common Lisp is my choice, while MIT-Scheme is the recommendation of SICP. Download it from: <https://common-lisp.net/downloads/>. I am using CCL for it is the default in tutorial for Slimv.

Download Slim: https://github.com/slime/slime/releases.

Download Vim Plugin slimv.vim: <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2531>

Configurations in .vimrc

    let g:slimv_swank_cmd = '!start "<ccl dir>/wx86cl.exe"
     \ -l "<slime dir>\start-swank.lisp"'
