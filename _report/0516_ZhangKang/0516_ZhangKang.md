## Notes
### Contents:
1. UTD introduction
   - 40+ years history.
   - 前身 TI (Texs Instrument)
   - CS Department 规模较大
2. How to write technical papers in English
   - Typical IEEE/ACM conference requirements
   - Varied journal requirements
   - Typical paper structure
   - Analysis of some rejected papers
   - Practice
   - Typical Chinglish phrases and suggested replacements

### Keynotes
#### Typical IEEE/ACM conference requirements
- 8-page double columns
- ~5000 words
- Many conference allow 10-12 pages, 9pt
- CS Press, ACM Press
- At least 3 reviewers for each paper
- Some with rebuttal phrase

#### Varied journal requirements
- Some with page limit, others no limit
- Some require at least 70% unpublished content
- Special issues become popular
- 1 to 8 reviewers, 3 to 4 on average
- Author may recommend reviewers but editor may or may not use (建议推荐满)
- Result can be 
    1. major revision (with or without reviewers' further review)
    2. minor revision
    3. rejection
- Author provide review list *very important*

#### Typical paper structure

      previous publications on the topic
    - provide the rationale for the present study
    - state briefly and clearly your purpose in writing paper, AND your contributions
    - choose references carefully to provide the most important background information.
- Technical methods: "How did you study the problem?"
- Results
    - "What did you find?"
    - experimental performance evaluation for system work
    - complexity analysis for algorithm work
    - case studies with real world applications
- Discussion: "What do these finding mean?"
- Relate work
    - review most relevant work
    - comment on this similarity and differences of your work from them
    - what makes your work unique and worth doing?
    - Usually as section 2 (motivation), or 2nd last section (comparison)
- Conclusions and future work
    - "What do you conclude?"
    - what actions need to be taken as future work
    - any discussion of controversial issues

- collaborate with other researchers
- volunteers to review papers

#### Specific rules
- never start a new sentence with "and"
- avoid using "some", if really needed, use "certain"
