Use truncation (*) to search for words that begin with the same letters.

Truncation can also be used to replace any number of characters internally.

Use wildcard (?) to replace a single character.

wom?n retrieves woman or women

Terms are automatically stemmed, except in the author field, unless the "Autostemming off" feature is checked.

management returns manage, managed, manager, managers, managing, management

To search for an exact phrase or phrases containing stop words (and, or, not, near), enclose terms in braces or quotation marks.
