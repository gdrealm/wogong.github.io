 2. Solution Methods  
Two solution methods are available for solving structural problems in the ANSYS family of products: the h-method and the p-method. The h-method can be used for any type of analysis, but the p-method can be used only for linear structural static analyses. Depending on the problem to be solved, the h-method usually requires a finer mesh than the p-method. The p-method provides an excellent way to solve a problem to a desired level of accuracy while using a coarse mesh. In general, the discussions in this manual focus on the procedures required for the h-method of solution.
