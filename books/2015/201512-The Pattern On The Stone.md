the first is the principle of functional abstraction, which leads to the aforementioned hierarchy of causes and effects.

The third theme in this book, which won’t be fully addressed until the last chapter, is in some sense the antithesis of the first. There may be an entirely new way of designing and programming computers—a way not based on the standard methods of engineering.

In it, we’ll define a powerful set of building blocks: logical functions and finite-state machines. With these elements, it’s easy to build a computer.

we want to build a machine to act as a judge of the children’s game of Scissors/Paper/Rock.

(The position of the decimal point “floats” relative to the digits, so that a fixed number of digits can be used to represent a wide range of numbers.)

Many other types of digital computing devices, including most general-purpose computers, also advance their state at regular intervals, and the rate at which they advance is called the clock rate of the machine. Within a computer, time is not a continuous flow but a fixed sequence of transitions between states.

He presented me with the following famous puzzle, called the firing squad problem:

most of the names are obscure acronyms (such as FORTRAN, for FORmula TRANslation, and LISP, for LISt Processing).

When most of the work of conversion is done beforehand, the translation process is called compilation, and the program that performs the compilation is called a compiler. If most of the work is done while the program is being executed, then the process is called interpretation, and the program is called an interpreter.

science—Turing, Church, and another British mathematician named Emil Post all independently invented the idea of universal computation at roughly the same time.

This loss of entanglement, called decoherence, could turn out to be the Achilles heel of quantum mechanical computers.

In a sense, communication and storage are just two aspects of the same thing: communication sends a message from one place to another; storage “sends” a message from one time to another.

This leads us to another measure of information: The amount of information in a pattern of bits is equal to the length of the smallest computer program capable of generating those bits.

Again, the basic tool is some form of redundancy.
