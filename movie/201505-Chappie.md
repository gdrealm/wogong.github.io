In the near future, crime is patrolled by a mechanized police force. When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself. (120 mins.)

Chappie aka the movie, has a good end. No one really dies.

Deon is a little stupid for the story to move on. This is a movie then.
